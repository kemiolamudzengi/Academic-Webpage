My dad is a storyteller and my mom is a community builder. 
As their progeny, I fuse the two; I tell stories as I build learning communities.\
Iâ€™m an educator and researcher. \
As an educator, I teach introductory programming and visualization courses at UBC. 
In this role I explore ways to remove barriers that impede learning and develop support structures that address common misconceptions.  \
As a researcher, I study the socio-emotional factors that influence learning. \
My goal is to create and cultivate inclusive and supportive communities of teaching and learning in computing. \
To this end, I
- coordinate our teaching assistant training program 
- organize conferences, workshops, and support groups for faculty
- conduct research, explore pedagogy, teach students, and (of course) tell stories
